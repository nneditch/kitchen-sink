Long distance runaround/ Long time waiting to feel the sound/ I still remember the dream there.<br>
	—Yes 

In the early ’70s, prog rock provided release for music geeks in search of a more challenging alternative to the burgeoning arena-rock scene. Prog’s epic, sci-fi symphonies merged classical composition with futuristic form and churned the result out through Marshall stacks.
	
Decades later, prog’s style of innovative extravagance has translated into new minimalist genres that pride themselves on technical merit—from math rockers dedicated to deconstructing guitar scales and timing signatures to laptop aficionados composing noise for a new millennium. So is it once again time to bust out the J.S. Bach and Casiotone synthesizers?

####Science Fiction, Math and Music

Everybody got mixed feelings about the function and the form/ Everybody got to deviate from the norm.<br>
	—Rush
	
Math rock’s thunderous drums, guitar scales in place of power chords, and tricks with timing may have as much in common with jazz and the Dave Brubeck Quartet’s Time Out as it does with early ’90s hardcore. Oddly enough, the midpoint between the two—chronologically and aesthetically—is prog rock. Prog pillars Rush aimed for transcendental songwriting through fantastical voyages of sound and story. Despite tales of lost captains, lost ships and being lost in space, Rush actually wrote songs about emotion. Math rockers do much the same thing, through songs about atoms, politics and modern day (semi-) consciousness.

In arena rock’s heyday, Rush challenged other bands to resonate through packed civic centers and football fields with something more than drum fills. The band pushed its rock contemporaries to use their ten-minute guitar solos for good purpose. On a smaller scale, Louisville, Kentucky’s Slint emerged amid the early ’90s golden years of indie/college radio rock. Sint’s second record, Spiderland (1991), deconstructed rock with dark, driving epics while marking a return to the rock guitar solo considered by most indie rockers to belong to the self-indulgent dinosaurs of cock rock. This time it arrived in a new form: six-minute stretches of dissonant, distorted arpeggios that functioned as a primary plot rather than a secondary narrative to an already existing arrangement.

Slint was committed to experiments in song structure and shifting the understanding of guitars as a lead instrument, defiantly avoiding any semblance to the verse-chorus-bridge-chorus construct found even in the music of indie experimental godparents like Sonic Youth. Sixteen-bar arrangements were created through the layering of multiple instruments and repetitive guitar and bass lines. Their force was guttural, its droning completely mesmerizing.

Picking up where Slint left off were Chicago math rockers Don Caballero. Ian Williams—former guitarist for the band and current composer/guitarist for the art/tech rock band Battles—describes his commitment to composition that deviates from the norm as inescapable logic. “At this point, I wish I could play the straight and narrow game,” says Williams, “because I’d either have to be extremely confident … or really stupid because I never considered the piles of records that have come before I ever picked up a guitar.”

The atypical paths paved by prog and math rockers weren’t necessarily driven by confidence; instead, a lack of faith in rock’s typical constructs of persona and performance fueled prog and math rockers’ creation of new models that would foster and validate their own sensibilities. 

####Post-Laptop

Said the straight man to the late man/ Where have you been/ I’ve been here and I’ve been there/ And I’ve been in between.<br>
	—King Crimson 
	
In 1972, Yes released its seminal album, Fragile. The band utilized the most advanced technology available at the time (mellotron, electric piano, synthesizer) to compose contemporary symphonies, even recording a song which borrows from Brahms’ Symphony No.4 in E Minor Third Movement. “Cans and Brahms,” the liner notes explain, is “an adaptation by Rick Wakemen on which he plays electric piano taking the part of strings, grand piano electric harpsichord taking reeds and synthesizer taking contra bassoon.”
	
How can anyone live up to ingenuity this maniacal? Prog relies heavily on the musician’s dedication to exploring not only the technical potential of his instrument, but also to cultivating an ear for interesting composition. Like abstract painting, there’s no rhetoric to your work if you haven’t studied art history and seen what you’re abstracting. But the DIY aesthetic brought to music via punk swung the pendulum to the other end. Studying composition and instrumentation—the way many of us are forced by our parents to study piano or violin—is not only boring, it’s just uncool.
	
Ian Williams explains: “Punk kind of won the cultural war, and I grew up under the dominance of its austerity. So I’ve always looked at what I play [as] kind of simple. It might be the Descendants times five, but it’s still a multiple of the Descendents.”
	
The new school does opt for a minimalist approach rather than the over-the-top flourishes of prog. The goal is to use simplicity to capture an aesthetic rather than construct a new paradigm. If everything’s been done before, why pretend that you’re making something entirely new? Attention to complicated composition doesn’t automatically make something pretentious, but post-post-modern artists pride themselves on being self-conscious of the fact that they’re self-conscious. Old-school prog rockers were in some ways too naïve to think this way.

The use of technology, however, has remained a mainstay among prog’s scions. Art-rock bands also combine organic with synthetic instrumentation, but their goal is a more sonic than symphonic sound. Contemporary composers are part-time techies applying their capable hands to a computer’s controls. Laptops are stationed atop synthesizer stands awaiting a single keypunch to release accompanying arrangements. Employing Wakeman’s concept from more than 30 years ago, in this case the composer substitutes synthesized, computer-programmed parts for piano and guitars, rather than strings and bassoon.

Prog and art rockers’ commitment to composition in terms of study—history and context—is a binding thread. What differs is their awareness of presentation. Neither fear being considered the academics of rock ’n’ roll, but where prog rockers thought their grandeur brazen, art rockers think it pompous. Ultimately, though, the homemade slide projections that art rockers favor aren’t any less self-indulgent than the laser light shows of the arena rock era.

####Into the Future

Prog challenged compositional form and saved a stifled rock scene. Its descendants have done something similar, though genres and tastes have become so diverse it’s nearly impossible to create a categorical classification like “progressive rock.”
	
Considering the divergence of music into micro-genres, prog may be simply outmoded, having served its purpose as a temporary fix for rock. Though ’70s bands outside prog experimented with rock’s boundaries, most continued to stay grounded in pop and rock paradigms. What’s surprising today is that despite all the ’70s musical Xeroxing going on, no one seems to be stepping up to proclaim themselves prog’s official copycats. Technology and a continued interest in the avant garde have made it possible to increase the appeal of prog, so why does it seem like no one is trying? Prog looked back hundreds of years for inspiration; most modern music won’t search farther back than the last 30 or 40 years. Other genres that made their mark in the ’70s (Gang of Four’s post-rock, early B-52’s pop/no wave, Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark’s romantic electro) have all seen a resurgence. The exception is prog. Instead, a few new bands use prog as a construct to build into and out from, much like prog did with classical, which may be a tribute to the influence of prog’s goal to incite evolution in lieu of imitation. 
	
A prog-rock redux would be awful if its instigators were as hollow as the fashonista neo-new wave bands or the disaffected post-rockers with ironic trucker hats, if only because of prog rockers’ infamous penchant for mullethead hair styles. But there’s no posturing in longing for something grandiose when it’s still smart, substantial and sci-fi. 

*Carla Costa advises that you crank Rush to 11 and do some herky-jerky dancing.*
