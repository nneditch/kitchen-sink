##Money

A shifty, lanky looking guy came into my bar one day, unchained a wallet from an elaborately buckled belt, unhooked a huge ring of keys, lighters, chains, lanyards and what looked like mountain climbing equipment, and banged the entire apparatus down on the bar top. He ordered a Yukon Jack on ice, a drink right out of my worst high school vomiting experiences, and made a beeline for the jukebox, where he proceeded to put, I feared, about five dollars worth of Pink Floyd’s “Money” into the machine.

This guy had to be a Pink Floyd man: big ’70s glasses, a wormy ’70s kind of mustache. His eyes were not good, not healthy looking; they were half shut in a narcotic way. I watched his half-eyes scan the jukebox looking for what could only be Pink Floyd’s “Money.” I braced myself for the signature opening cash register sounds of “Money,” which signaled an upcoming three minute, 58 second trip down memory lane for this poor schmuck and for me.

When he got back to his stool at the bar, I’m sure he noticed right away the absence of any tumblers or glasses filled with Yukon Jack, as I had not yet been able to muster the inner strength necessary to pour it. I was busy thinking about how to somehow protect myself from the song, “Money,” the way crazy people think they may protect themselves from alien transmissions by putting aluminum foil hats on their heads. I was also deciding whether to serve him at all, or exercise my supreme bartenderly right of refusal, kick him out, unplug the jukebox before “Money” came on, and before I smash it, and perhaps every bottle behind me, smash the giant round mirror that hovered above us all. What a great smashing it would be, and only two things kept me from doing it. 1) It was perhaps a too-obvious reference to the Who’s rock opera, Tommy, where the smashing of a mirror takes on the utmost pop-psychological significance; and 2) I was already hearing—in my head, mind you, the opening cash register sounds and bass line to the song, “Money,” by Pink Floyd, and felt much was lost already.

“Hey, buddy,” the ’70s guy said. “Where’s my Yukon Jack?”

And so a decision would need to be made.

There comes a spot in every bartender’s life where they become saturated. Just like in your own job—you’ve seen too much of the same thing, or repeated the same task so many times that it hits you what a monotonous, repetitive, endlessly cycling, infinitely recursive claustrophobic world we’ve created. I’d imagine, for example, that filling an ice bucket might be what saturates some bartenders. Every day, two or three times, going over to the ice machine and filling up a bucket. It starts to seem pointless—the ice, frozen water; you’re a water hauler, and you think, what am I doing here, hauling, and with my life? It’s the demon thought, and once allowed, each ice-filling is another petal plucked from your life’s flower, each scoop brings you one day closer to death.

Not me though; I had no problem with ice. I loved ice and filling an ice bucket, opening the ice machine door and the always surprising blast of cool air, the thrusting of a steel scoop, the over-abundance; like there is enough ice here to last us through the nuclear war when it comes! But ice was not my saturation problem—it was clearly Pink Floyd’s song, “Money,” which sent me over the edge.

The Pink Floyd song, “Money,” was a selection on the jukebox—a good jukebox being a vital component to any bar’s life. There are people who think fondly about jukeboxes and cherish them and patronize a particular bar because of a particular jukebox. It would seem fairly obvious why this is so: People love good music, and bar habitués are no exception. But if you think about it, bar jukeboxes deliver music to us in an alien and contrary way, satisfying some unexplored desire people have to pay money in order to broadcast their favorite songs to a room full of strangers, and hear those songs in patterns of almost infinite repetition.

The result is the creation of a monster. Beware the jukebox, my friends; it is nothing more than a concealed weapon. A colorful machine on the outside, a little neon or bubbling water, offering a song we like for a quarter, maybe fifty cents—what could be more innocent? But inside hides a darker mechanism, one that fosters a notion of time stopped! Of continuous nostalgia, tended to like a fragile garden, creating a space of dangerous timelessness, one where as long as I pay, I can listen to the old songs, the classics. I can be reminded, sweetly, sadly of the good times, the difficult times, the adolescent times that I used music to get me through. I want those times back! Help me jukebox! Fifty cents? That’s nothing, I’d pay hundreds for the opportunity! Then I realize I can’t go back, I can’t really have the beautiful nostalgia from the good ol’ days—so out of reach in this bar—and that makes it even harder, makes me want the music even more. And more! And another drink over here, OK buddy?

While this can be a subversive experience for the listener, it can have devastating effects on the bartender and other staff. It’s bad enough to try to live with your own painful past and unfulfilled desires, but god help you when you have to live through somebody else’s.

Pink Floyd’s “Money” was very high indeed on painful-past nostalgia lists. It did something for bar-goers. Especially guys. Turned them to Jell-O. As we know, it was a huge hit track on Pink Floyd’s seminal album, Dark Side of the Moon—required listening back when turntables and vinyl records were the preferred music delivery systems. Nobody was without a Dark Side of the Moon. There was a prism on the cover, a beam of white light entering one side, then scattering into its constituent colors on the other—another personality metaphor, ’70s rock was full of them. Did you know just how fractured adolescent boys were in the ’70s?

I read recently that people are still buying Dark Side of the Moon! It is still on the best-seller lists. This is mind-boggling to me. Although when I looked at my ’70s guy, sitting there complacently waiting for his Yukon Jack, I guess I understood. His patient waiting was unnerving. But at least he had Pink Floyd to help him through it. How long would he wait without saying something else? His arms were folded across the bartop, his narcotic eyes inward, and was he even breathing? I thought perhaps he was holding his breath and I realized that I was holding mine. This caused another unwelcome song from Dark Side of the Moon to crawl into my head, “Breathe.”  “Breathe” tells us, Breathe. Breathe in the air. Don’t be afraid to care. 

I exhaled. Then “Money” started its assault from the sound system.

Sometimes my dreams were centered around various permutations of the song, “Money.” The sound of a cash register ringing anywhere, my bar or otherwise, started the song “Money” playing in my head. Change clinking in my pocket, various wind chimes and many noises of my car started “Money.” Driving home, driving to work, eating dinner, brushing my teeth, blowing my nose, pissing, shitting, standing, sitting, were often accompanied by the soundtrack, “Money,” by Pink Floyd. I was so completely familiar with every note, every aspect of the song, that I could hum it all, sing every part, recreate every sound in perfect pitch and meter using no instruments whatsoever, save my own voice, hands and skin.

That the song itself is an attempted ironic commentary on capitalism and consumerism doesn’t help much. You could drive yourself crazy thinking about all the loser guys putting their money into jukeboxes to hear Pink Floyd sing ironically about money—and just how filthy rich Pink Floyd became because of it.

At that moment I also realized I was juggling not one, but two Pink Floyd songs in my head—“Money,” and “Breathe”—and I let them battle it out for a moment. They soon melded into one song and I realized that they really were the same song! That probably every song on Dark Side of the Moon was one evil song, sped up or slowed down, recorded with different words, but still essentially the same freakin’ song. I again thought about breaking glass, breaking bottles as the only possible antidote to this music.

I heard the ’70s guy exhale behind me. “Breathe…” I thought.

And I spun and reached for the bottle of Yukon Jack, and I grabbed it by its grubby little neck.

“Money…” said the song, “it’s a gas!”
