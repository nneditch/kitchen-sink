##The Characters of Metallica 
###Full Metal Racket

by Henry Crush

Recently, I went to see Some Kind of Monster, the Metallica documentary. I have never been a fan of Metallica, but on a Saturday, the feeling was right for real-life tales of metal group therapy, so a girl named Smith and I smuggled in Indian1 food and braced ourselves for the metal2 meltdown.

It probably sounds like a no-brainer, but I was surprised by how dumb the guys in Metallica sound onscreen. I realize, however, that they were followed around constantly for a year or so by camera men who were not trying to make Metallica look and sound good (nor were they intentionally being trashed), and I know that if I was in Metallica, I’d look just (OK, almost) as dumb as the band members do in Some Kind of Monster, even if I hadn’t suffered the inevitable brain damage that must result from being in Metallica throughout the ’80s. If I’d tried out for bass during the doc, I would’ve looked as befuddled as Nick on Freaks and Geeks, on the episode in which he auditions for a “real” band (he plays drums, but you get the idea). Dude, I am not built for speed. 

At any rate, I’m glad Metallica picked up Robert Trujillo, the bass player from Suicidal Tendencies (and Ozzy’s band)—I would’ve totally rooted for him if the documentarians hadn’t made it obvious from the outset of the audition sequence that Trujillo was the man. I mean, I rooted for him anyway, but there was no drama. Haven’t these folks seen Spellbound? What, spelling bees can have you chewing your seat cushion, but auditions for one of the hugest bands on earth don’t beg some tension?

OK, so, the guys are dumb. But also sincere, and that surprised me as well. I figured Metallica would be a bunch of aloof millionaires, the types who would insult and disregard their fans by suing them for “stealing” the band’s music. Nope—the old boys of Metallica are just dumb; sincere and dumb. To be fair, it looks, in the doc, like the rest of the meatheads pretty much ignored Lars Ulrich while he went on his destroy-all-credibility Napster rampage. To be even fairer, the singer, James Hetfield, is not really a meathead, or he at least exhibits signs of an interior life, and guitarist Kirk Hammett is a cuddly bear—a latent homosexual cuddly bear. My favorite strain of the movie is Kirk Hammett looking hurt and lost while Hetfield and Ulrich fight their passive aggressive wars. I don’t remember the singer and drummer ever looking each other in the eye—I’m pretty sure they decided years ago that it wasn’t a good idea. 

But back to Kirk Hammett: He’s so sweet, and he has ponies, and he loves loves loves his band mates. You guys, don’t you see what you’re doing to Kirk Hammett? Can’t you just make up, if you must continue to deny Kirk Hammett the hugs he so desperately needs?

Contrary to evidence like the Napster lawsuits against fans, and the massive, anonymous, head banging crowds Metallica’s been playing to for much longer than the guys in Metallica can remember without pictures, Metallica comes off in the film3 as a band that genuinely appreciates its fans. Go figure.

Aside from that4, Some Kind of Monster was like the best reality show ever,5 i.e., a “real life” Spinal Tap. I must be the millionth person to make the Tap comparison, but some things are repeated because they make sense. The actors in Tap got so carried away with the act, they performed live as a band and released albums, though I’m not sure whether they did it out of the need to rock, if they were seized by post-ironic midlife crises, if they needed the money, or if they were exercising a sense of the absurd. Anyway, the point is that while the band Spinal Tap was born from movie satire, Metallica seem made for film in Some Kind of Monster. You can’t write characters like those guys.

I absolutely love to say metal. Metal. Which reminds me of my all-time favorite bathroom graffiti:<br>
penis<br>
it isn’t a band<br>
i just love writing the word penis<br>

I’m going to give up calling Some Kind of Monster a documentary now, OK? See my next point.

Though it’s not enough to make me want to buy a Metallica album, I was hungry for metal after the show. What I really wanted was something new by the Fucking Champs. Lo and behold, a couple days later I received a promo for Gold, by the Fucking AM, which is a recording project between the Fucking Champs and Trans Am. Trans Am sucks now, but Gold is good, even if I haven’t been motivated to listen to the whole thing. It’s got an epic opening track, anyway.

Thanks to Smith for pointing this out.
