##Classical Yo-Yo
###In Which Our Reporter Puts on Spiffy Duds

It’s a Friday night in San Francisco. Parking is total bollocks, which is usually not the case in this hood, unless the orchestra or opera is getting jiggy. Which is, unfortunately, the case tonight. We circle around and around the outer edges of Hayes Valley, glaring at men in ties and women in dresses and high heels. They’re going to the orchestra. They’ve found a parking spot. After perhaps the fifth or sixth circle of an eight-block square, some kamikaze maneuvering gets us a spot.
	
Accompanying me tonight to Davies Symphony Hall is Mr. Dan Strachota, local music writer and certified music snob of the highest order. Like most music snobs, he doesn’t understand that other people have highly developed auditory inclinations as well. If other people have musical tastes that are different from his, their musical tastes must suck.
	
Such is Dan’s sentencing of classical music. To be fair, one time he seemed genuinely interested in a Parkening classical guitar interpretation of “Afro-Cuban Lullaby.” And another time I coerced him into listening to the Eroica Symphony in its entirety by having sex with him (jumping up halfway to flip the record over—the lengths I’ll go to spread the classical music love). Afterwards, he let out a big sigh and said, “I didn’t know Beethoven could get you so worked up.”
	
Tonight I’m not counting on getting Dan worked up so much as I’m hoping he won’t fall asleep. The last time he went to see the San Francisco Symphony, he dozed off before intermission. Still, I’d prefer to see him asleep rather than bobbing his leg impatiently and sighing between movements. 

####Music Appreciation
I have a rather poorly developed theory that in order to truly understand and appreciate classical music, you must have played in an orchestra at some point. I don’t think this holds up for everyone, but it certainly does for me. I didn’t like classical music until I started to play it. And then bang I fell in love. So in love. More in love than I have been with anything or anyone in my life. In comparison, writing is an anemic, sickly substitute. I used to cry when I’d play, especially in orchestra, which is a difficult position to be in when you’re playing a bassoon. Cello, yeah, maybe doable, but when you’re trying to keep a steady flow of air moving through a double reed, good luck, girlie. 
	
I abandoned bassoon halfway through college, and have regretted the move on and off ever since. The closest I can get to that feeling I once had—that euphoric high, that feeling of intimacy and connection with a community of likeminded individuals—is through live music. And that’s part of the reason I’m so excited about tonight.

Dan and I visit the Rickshaw Stop, a club two blocks from Davies Hall, where he DJs every Wednesday night (playing neither Mozart nor Mahler). We’re looking pretty spiffed up. Dan’s actually wearing a shirt that’s a solid color and is strictly cotton, and I’ve got on my favorite knee-high boots and a sweater all too happy to highlight my cleavage. Waldo and Christopher, the owners of the Rickshaw, comment on our duds, and Dan tells them we’re on our way to the orchestra.

“What’s on the bill tonight?” Waldo asks.<br>
“Um... Takemitsu’s From Me Flows What You Call Time and Holst’s The Planets,” I tell them.<br>
Waldo nods his head. “Isn’t The Planets supposed to be really long?”<br>
Dan gives them a despairing look as I drag him back onto the street.<br>

A garden never spurns those who enter it.
	—Toru Takemitsu

We have good seats, in the middle balcony, and Dan and I sit down just before the orchestra takes the stage. I am so excited. I don’t know how to express it adequately. The formality of it all soothes me: the regulated applause, the delicate coughing between movements, the respectful silence.
	
The first half of the concert is reserved for Takemitsu’s piece, which premiered at Carnegie Hall in 1990, six years before Takemitsu died. While the piece is scored for five percussionists and orchestra, the orchestra members take turns soloing in the piece as well. There’s a great deal of symbolism at work in this piece, with the number of soloists representing different concepts in Tibetan Buddhism. The five soloists are meant to symbolize the five elements of sky, water, fire, earth and wind, and each soloist is dressed in different colors (blue, white, yellow, red and green), which are associated with the colors of the prayer flags of the Tibetan Wind Horse, which in turn represents enlightenment. Five cords of different colors run from the stage to the balcony, where wind chimes are tied.
	
There’s a hell of a lot more symbolism at work here, but ultimately, it’s not important. What is important is the music. The sound is dreamy and drunken, with repeated full orchestral glissandos that contrast sharply with the percussion. There’s something completely ethereal about the sound that at the same time reeks of earthiness, of the ground beneath one’s feet. It makes me tremble, lean forward in my seat, and start to cry.

I sneak a look at Dan and he’s not asleep, he’s not bobbing his leg, he’s not sighing. He looks completely fascinated.

####Lights Up

I’ve made scorecards for Dan and myself to keep track of any audience or orchestral incidents of interest. I originally devised the scorecards as a way of helping Dan to stay awake, but now I’m glad that I made them for me as well. It’s fun to zip around Davies during intermission, eavesdropping on folks and checking out all the boring or wack fashion. The flyest couple I see is a rather hefty young lady with spiked bleach-blonde hair in a yellow checkered three-piece suit, her arm around her equally hefty, equally bleach-blonde, prom-dress-sportin’ girlfriend.
	
As I attempt to sip from my near-rubbing-alcohol quality $8 vodka cran, I realize that I am in couples hell. There is, literally, not a single single person here. And what’s more, a good portion of the crowd is gay. I mean, it’s San Francisco, yes, I know, there’s going to be a sizable gay population anywhere I go, but I usually don’t notice it. Here though, I’d say that the gay couples nearly match the number of hetero couples. Which is so cool. I wonder if the gay couples are going to become the new orchestrati, if their patronage will ensure lots of avant-garde gay composers in San Francisco’s future.

####Planet Holst

During the second half of the concert, the orchestra reconvenes to play The Planets. Each movement is beautiful and striking and different from the last. Unfortunately, this piece has been shoplifted from so often it starts to sound derivative of other, more familiar pop culture pieces (such as the themes from Star Wars or Harry Potter). All I can say is John Williams is a boring, lame jerkface. Still, despite all this, I can’t help myself, and again I get swept away by the sound. And I start to cry, silently, my eyes tearing and blurring over. I can’t believe what an orchestra crybaby I am. I wipe my eyes and glance over at Dan. He isn’t asleep, though he doesn’t seem nearly as thrilled as he was with the first piece.
	
After the final movement, after the clapping and the endless filing out of the hall, we spill out onto the street. I hook my arm through Dan’s as we walk down Van Ness towards the car.

“Did you have a good time?” I ask him.<br>
He nods his head. “I did,” he says. “Especially the Takemitsu. That was great.”<br>
“But did it make you cry?” I ask him.<br>
He snorts a little and shakes his head. “No, it didn’t make me cry,” he says. “You’re the cryer in this relationship, remember?”<br>

I remember. But I also remember the way my throat would start to bob up and down when I’d sit in a folding chair on some cold winter stage when I was 19, my bassoon slung across my body, my thumb struggling to find the D flick key out of the nine allotted for that thumb alone. And how all that sound would well big in my throat until I just wanted to sob. 
	
The music is still that powerful to me. And maybe you don’t need to play in an orchestra to love classical music. But it sure helps to make you a crybaby about it.
